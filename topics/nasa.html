  <h3>The NASA Circus Act</h3>
  <p>
    They call it science, but it’s really more like a magic show with
    a trillion‑dollar budget. NASA—our glorious national altar of 
    “space exploration”—has been milking taxpayers for decades while 
    spoon‑feeding the masses their fancy‑filtered CGI fantasies. Every 
    year, they roll out new pictures of blue marbles, “alien discoveries,” 
    and rocket fireworks that do little more than remind people to stay 
    quiet and nod whenever “experts” talk.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let’s be honest: NASA’s main mission isn’t to explore anything; it’s 
    to keep the illusion alive. They dress up engineers like prophets, 
    parade astronauts around like saints. The whole act whispers, 
    "don’t think too hard, just trust the scientists". Meanwhile, all 
    their evidence of a spinning space ball fits neatly into Photoshop 
    and animated PowerPoints.

    Criticize them and watch what happens—dissent isn’t tolerated, only 
    devotion. They can’t handle people asking to many questions. Like why 
    their “photos” don’t match, or why no one has stepped on the Moon 
    since disco was popular. But why would they? As long as the checks 
    keep coming, the show must go on.
    
    NASA isn’t a space agency; it’s a well funded, organized 
    disinformation campaign. An organization that skillfully
    creates and perpetuats the illusion that we’re tiny, 
    insignificant specs floating in a limitless void. 
    It’s a cosmic distraction—a control story wrapped in shiny 
    aluminum foil and sold as heroism. And the audience still 
    cheers.

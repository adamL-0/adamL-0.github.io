    In this age of smart devices and speculation, there 
    yet endures a quiet conviction among certain inquirers: 
    that the world upon which we dwell is neither a spinning 
    orb lost in void, nor a mere accident of celestial mechanics, 
    but a grand, deliberate plane â€” calm, stable, and divinely 
    proportioned. This conception, known as the Flat Earth Model, 
    restores majesty and purpose to a cosmos grown cold with 
    abstraction.
